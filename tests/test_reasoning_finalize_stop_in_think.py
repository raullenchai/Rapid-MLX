"""D-STOP-THINK: cross-parser-family regression tests.

Bug shape (cross-cycle bundle, 6 parser families confirmed):
when ``stop`` matches inside an unterminated ``<think>`` block OR
``max_tokens`` cuts mid-thought before ``</think>``, BOTH ``content`` AND
``reasoning_content`` receive the SAME buffered thinking trace on the
non-streaming OpenAI envelope AND on the Anthropic / Responses streaming
envelopes.

Cross-cycle evidence:

* qwen3 reasoning — bug_report.md:128, cycle-3 F-3, cycle-7 F-1 (nemotron-30b)
* hermes — cycle-5 F-1 (qwen3.5-27b-8bit, hermes tool parser layered on qwen3)
* glm4 — cycle-8 F-801 (glm4.7-9b-4bit)
* deepseek_r1 — cycle-11 F-11-7 (phi-4-mini-reasoning)
* gemma4 — cycle-6 F-CORR-2 (gemma-4-26b/12b)
* VibeThinker (DeepSeekR1 subclass) — cycle-2 F-12-1

Root cause (cross-family): each parser's ``finalize_streaming`` path
(and Gemma4's ``extract_reasoning`` channel-grammar variant) emitted
the buffered text into the ``content`` channel when the close marker
was never crossed. The streaming loop had already shipped the same
bytes as ``reasoning_content`` (thinking_delta on Anthropic;
delta.reasoning_content on OpenAI; thinking event on Responses), so
the finalize emission re-sent the trace as a fresh text block / text
delta — duplicating the trace into both channels.

Fix (shared base-class invariant): ``BaseThinkingReasoningParser``
exposes ``_finalize_in_think_block(accumulated_text)`` — True when
``</think>`` is absent — and a default ``finalize_streaming`` that
returns ``None``. Subclasses MUST NOT emit ``content`` when this
invariant holds; the Qwen3 / DeepSeek-R1 finalize correction paths
now surface the rescue text via ``reasoning`` so the Anthropic /
Responses routes' ``final_msg.content`` gate stays silent (no wire
duplication) while parser-contract callers (this test, custom routes)
still see the rescue signal.

These tests exercise the SHARED invariant across every
``BaseThinkingReasoningParser`` subclass + the Gemma 4 channel-grammar
variant, plus a Hermes-with-reasoning composition smoke test. They
also cover the ``max_tokens``-cut variant (same accumulator state as
``stop``-mid-think; the engine truncates the suffix in both cases).
