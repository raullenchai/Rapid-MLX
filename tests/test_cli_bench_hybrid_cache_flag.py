"""#1103 codex BLOCKING-2 / BLOCKING-3: ``--hybrid-cache-entries`` must be
honored by the benchmark path (not only ``serve``), and the test that proves
it must run fully OFFLINE.

The bench ``SchedulerConfig`` assembly reads ``args.hybrid_cache_entries`` (via
``getattr(..., 0)``) at ``cli.py`` and passes it as
``hybrid_cache_entries=...``; the scheduler then forwards it to the memory
cache as ``hybrid_reuse_max_entries``. The flag was originally registered ONLY
on ``serve_parser``, so ``rapid-mlx bench --hybrid-cache-entries N`` was
rejected by argparse and, had a caller reached the config assembly, it would
have silently fallen back to 0.

These tests exercise the real ``main()`` parser AND the real ``bench_command``
plumbing in-process, mocking only the model-loading / disk / network
boundaries, so:

* BLOCKING-2 — we assert the parsed value ACTUALLY arrives at
  ``SchedulerConfig(hybrid_cache_entries=4)``. If the ``cli.py`` bench plumbing
  line is deleted, this test fails (the argparse-only check could not).
* BLOCKING-3 — NO network access happens: the disk/memory checks, the mirror
  pre-fetch (``_ensure_model_downloaded``) and ``mlx_lm.load`` are all mocked,
  and the download gate is skipped under a non-TTY stdin, so a bogus HF-style
  model id never triggers external resolution / 60s retry timeouts.
